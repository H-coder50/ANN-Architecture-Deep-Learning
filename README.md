#         **ANN Architecture** 
### **File Description:**
**Purpose**
This file documents the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture used in the project. It provides a clear overview of the model’s structure, layers, and flow of data, making it easier for collaborators and learners to understand, reproduce, or extend the work.
**Contents**
- Model Overview
  - Explains the type of ANN and its intended application (classification).
- Layer Structure
  - Input Layer: Defines the number of input features.
  - Hidden Layers: Specifies the number of layers, neurons per layer, and activation functions (relu)
  - Output Layer: Describes the output size and activation (sigmoid)
- Training Details
  - Loss function (binary_crossentropy)
  - Optimizer (adam)
- Visualization
  - plots for visual loss and accuracy
- Conclusion
  - confusion matrix (accuracy score)
